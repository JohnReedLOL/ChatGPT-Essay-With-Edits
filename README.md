An essay generated with ChatGPT that I edit. Each version is a commit.

I asked ChatGPT to write the following prompt: "Write an expository essay arguing against the use of the death penalty."

It wrote:

The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is the practice of executing individuals as punishment for certain crimes. While it has been used throughout history in various forms, it is still a controversial and divisive issue today. In this essay, I will argue that the death penalty should not be used for several reasons.

First, there is a significant risk of executing innocent people. Despite advances in forensic science and legal processes, mistakes do happen and innocent people can be wrongly convicted. In the United States, over 150 people have been exonerated and released from death row due to new evidence of their innocence. This is a terrifying prospect, as the death penalty is irreversible and once someone is executed, there is no way to correct the mistake.

Second, the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the threat of the death penalty does not significantly reduce the rates of violent crime. In fact, some states with the death penalty have higher rates of crime than those without it. This suggests that other factors, such as poverty, access to education and mental health resources, and community support, play a much larger role in deterring crime.

Third, the death penalty is a costly and inefficient use of resources. The process of seeking the death penalty is often more expensive than life imprisonment, as it requires additional legal proceedings and appeals. In addition, the death penalty is prone to lengthy delays, with some cases taking decades to resolve. This puts a burden on the criminal justice system and takes resources away from other areas that may be more effective in reducing crime and improving public safety.

Fourth, the death penalty raises moral and ethical concerns. Many people argue that it is wrong for the state to take a life, regardless of the circumstances. Others believe that the death penalty does not adequately address the root causes of crime and does not provide opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation. There is also a risk of bias in the application of the death penalty, with people of color, people with low income, and people with mental illnesses being disproportionately affected.

In conclusion, the death penalty is a flawed and ineffective punishment that carries significant risks and costs. It does not deter crime, can lead to the execution of innocent people, and raises moral and ethical concerns. Instead of relying on the death penalty, we should focus on improving the criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of crime in order to create a safer and more just society.
