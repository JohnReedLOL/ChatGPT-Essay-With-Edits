An essay generated with ChatGPT that I edit. Each version is a commit.

I asked ChatGPT to write the following prompt: "Write an expository essay arguing against the use of the death penalty."

It wrote:

Capital punishment, or the death penalty, is the practice of executing individuals as punishment for certain crimes. Various methods of capital punishment have been used throughout history, with various levels of violence and pain inflicted, but even with the more humane recent methodologies, it still is a controversial and divisive issue in society. I will argue that the death penalty should not be used for several reasons.

First, there is a non-zero risk of executing innocent people. Despite advances in forensic science and legal processes, mistakes do happen and innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted. In the United States, over 150 people have been exonerated and released from death row due to new evidence of their innocence. This is a terrifying prospect, as the death penalty is irreversible, and the death of innocent people cannot be rectified.

Second, the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime. Studies have shown that the threat of the death penalty does not significantly reduce the rates of violent crime. In fact, some states with the death penalty have higher rates of crime than those without it. This suggests that other factors, such as poverty, access to education and mental health resources, and community support, play a much larger role in deterring crime. In addition, it is not uncommon for criminals to actually prefer a quick and painless death over a long, drawn out, and miserable lifetime in prison, especially as their time in prison goes on and on.

Third, the death penalty is a costly and inefficient use of resources. The process of seeking the death penalty is often more expensive than life imprisonment, as it requires additional legal proceedings and appeals. The death penalty is prone to lengthy delays, with some cases taking decades to resolve. This puts a burden on the criminal justice system and takes resources away from other areas that may be more effective in reducing crime and improving public safety. One study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million, significantly higher than the life in prison cost.

Fourth, the death penalty raises moral and ethical concerns. Many people argue that it is wrong for the state to take a life, regardless of the circumstances. Others believe that the death penalty does not adequately address the root causes of crime and does not provide opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation, which according to one theory of justice is the purpose of the justice system. There is also a risk of bias in the application of the death penalty, with people of color, people with low income, and people with mental illnesses being disproportionately affected.

In conclusion, the death penalty is a flawed and ineffective punishment that carries significant risks and costs. It does not deter crime, can lead to the execution of innocent people, and raises moral and ethical concerns. Instead of relying on the death penalty, we should focus on improving the criminal justice system and addressing the root causes of crime in order to create a safer and more just society.
